# Stock Screener

React + Vite UI for viewing daily stock snapshots.

- `npm run dev` / `make dev` – start the dev server
- `npm run build` / `make build` – production bundle
- Data CSVs live under `public/data` and are fetched at `/data/*.csv`
- Legacy vanilla JS implementation is archived in `legacy/`

Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:8000/stock-screener/` to explore the table and heatmap views.
